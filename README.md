# spotify-github-profile

This is a tool that posts the currently playing song on Spotify on your Github profile.
Please paste the URL generated by running Go and Vue using Vercel or a self-hosted server into your profile using an iframe etc...

## How to use

Plz place the .env file in the directory where `backend` is located.
What you need .env is Spotify's ClientID and ClientSecret not necessary confirm REFRESH.
(Confirm it using env.example)
Please set the redirect URL to `http://localhost4400`. There is no problem in filling in the rest in text.

## others

I'm currently learning Go and Vue, so I think there are a lot of flaws. I'd be very thanksful if the developers could give me any corrections or advice.ðŸ˜Š
